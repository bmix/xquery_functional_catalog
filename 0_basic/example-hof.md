##Examples of Higher-Order Functions in XQuery

Here are a few examples of [higher-order functions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function) in XQuery. For more examples, see the very nice discussion of higher-order functions in XQuery 3.0 at the [BaseX website](http://docs.basex.org/wiki/Higher-Order_Functions).

N.B. In some implementations, these functions may not be implemented or may have different names/function signatures. The first four functions have been tested using [Saxon PE](http://www.saxonica.com/download/download_page.xml) and the second four using [Zorba](http://try.zorba.io/queries/xquery).
